As you may know, increased flooding on Port Royal has led to pooling water and dangerous driving conditions. This project focuses on a two-acre site on the Schuylkill Center landscape uphill from Smith Run, a first-order spring-fed stream that runs through our property. The project site is adjacent to Port Royal Avenue, where a low point in the road allows water to collect and where the stormwater runoff has carved a gully into the adjacent hillside, carrying soil and debris into Wind Dance pond and Smith Run.</p><p class="mcePastedContent"><br /></p><p class="mcePastedContent">Below are slides provided by SCEE:</p><p class="mcePastedContent"><br /></p><p class="mcePastedContent"><a href="https://mcusercontent.com/2ab808daa7adb1455138f095d/files/5c792930-c64e-2c79-ca90-37b85ce622d4/Port_Royal_Gully_Presentation_.01.pdf"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/2ab808daa7adb1455138f095d/images/5c9a3287-1b7d-0184-3501-cca91a375c57.png" style="max-width: 100%;" width="612" height="341" /></a></p><p class="mcePastedContent"><br /></p><p class="mcePastedContent last-child"><br /></p></div>
